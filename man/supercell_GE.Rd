\title{Simplification of scRNA-seq dataset}
\usage{
supercell_GE(ge, groups, do.median.norm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ge}{gene expression matrix (or any coordinate matrix) with genes as rows and cells as cols}

\item{groups}{vector of membership (assignment of single-cell to super-cells)}

\item{do.median.norm}{whether to normalize}
}
\value{
a matrix of simplified (averaged withing groups) data with ncol equal to number of groups and nrows as in the initial dataset
}
\description{
This function converts gene-expression matrix of single-cell data into a gene expression
matrix of super-cells
}
