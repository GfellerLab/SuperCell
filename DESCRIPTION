Title: Simplification of scRNA-Seq Data by Merging Together Similar Cells
Version: 1.0
Author: Mariia Bilous
Maintainer: Leonard Herault <leonard.herault@unil.ch>
Description: Aggregates large single-cell data into metacell dataset by merging together gene expression of very similar cells. 'SuperCell' uses 'velocyto.R' <https://github.com/velocyto-team/velocyto.R> for RNA velocity. We also recommend installig 'scater' Bioconductor package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scater.html>.
