# Analysis
## Load scRNA-seq data of 5 cancer cell lines from [Tian et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0425-8).
Data available at authors' [GitHub](https://github.com/LuyiTian/sc_mixology/blob/master/data/) under file name *sincell_with_class_5cl.Rdata*. 

```{r load data}
data(cell_lines) # list with GE - gene expression matrix (logcounts), meta - cell meta data
GE <- cell_lines$GE
dim(GE) # genes as rows and cells as columns
cell.meta <- cell_lines$meta
```
## Simplify single-cell data at the graining level $gamma = 20$
(i.e., `20` times less super-cells than single cells) by first building a kNN ($k=5$) network
using top $n.var.genes=1000$ most variable genes for dimentionality reduction. Function `SCimplify()` computes the partition into super-cells, this information is available with the field `membership`.

```{r Simplification, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
gamma <- 20 # graining level

SC <- SCimplify(GE,  # gene expression matrix 
                k.knn = 5, # number of nearest neighbors to build kNN network
                gamma = gamma, # graining level
                n.var.genes = 1000) # number of the top variable genes to use for dimentionality reduction 

# plot super-cell network
supercell_plot(SC$graph.supercells, # network
               color.use = "gray", # color of the nodes
               main = paste("Super-cell network, gamma =", gamma), 
               seed = 1) 

# plot single-cell network
supercell_plot(SC$graph.singlecell, # network
               group = cell.meta, # colored by cell line assignment
               do.frames = F, # not drawing frames around each node 
               main = paste("Single-cell network, N =", dim(GE)[2]), 
               lay.method = "components") # method to compute the network 2D embedding 
```

## Compute gene expression for simplified data
 To get a gene expression of super-cells, we need to average gene expressions within each super-cell with function `supercell_GE()` 
```{r average gene expression}
SC.GE <- supercell_GE(GE, SC$membership)
dim(SC.GE) 
```

## Map each super-cell to a particular cell line
We now assign super-cell to a particular cell line based on the cell line data, for this, we use function `supercell_assign()`. 
By default, this function assign each super-cell to a cluster with the largest Jaccard coefficient to avoid biases towards very rare or very abundant clusters. Alternatively, assigmnent can be performed using relative (may cause biase towards very small populations) or absolute (may cause biase towards large populations) abundance with `method = "relative"` or `method = "absolute"`, respectively. 
The quality of assigment can be evaluated with super-cell purity (function `supercell_purity()`) that returns the proportion of the most abundant cell type (in this case, cell line) in each super-cell.
```{r assign supercells  to cell line infromation}

SC2cellline  <- supercell_assign(clusters = cell.meta, # single-cell assigment to cell lines (clusters)
                                 supercell_membership = SC$membership, # single-cell assignment to super-cells
                                 method = "jaccard")
SC$cell_line <- SC2cellline


seed <- 1 # seed for super-cell network plotting 

# plot super-cell network colored by cell line assignment 
supercell_plot(SC$graph.supercells, 
               group = SC$cell_line, 
               seed = seed, 
               main = "Super-cell colored by cell line assignment")

# compute purity of super-cells in terms of cell line composition
purity <- supercell_purity(clusters = cell.meta, 
                           supercell_membership = SC$membership)
hist(purity, main = "Super-cell purity \nin terms of cell line composition")
```

Some options to plot super-cell networks
```{r plotting options}
## rotate network to be more consistent with the single-cell one
supercell_plot(SC$graph.supercells, 
               group = SC$cell_line, 
               seed = seed, 
               alpha = -pi/2,
               main  = "Super-cell colored by cell line assignment (rotated)")

## alternatively, any layout can be provided as 2xN numerical matrix, where N is number of nodes (cells)

## Let's plot super-cell network using the layout of the single-cell network:
## 1) get single-cell network layout 
my.lay.sc <- igraph::layout_components(SC$graph.singlecell) 

## 2) compute super-cell network layout averaging coordinates withing super-cells
my.lay.SC <- Matrix::t(supercell_GE(ge = t(my.lay.sc), groups = SC$membership))

## 3) provide layout with the parameter $lay$
supercell_plot(SC$graph.supercells, 
               group = SC$cell_line, 
               lay = my.lay.SC,
               main  = "Super-cell colored by cell line assignment (averaged coordinates)")
```

## Cluster super-cell data
```{r clustering}
#dimensionality reduction 
SC.PCA         <- supercell_prcomp(Matrix::t(SC.GE), # super-cell gene exptression matrix
                                   genes.use = SC$genes.use, # genes used for the coarse-graining, but any set can be provided
                                   supercell_size = SC$supercell_size, # sample-weighted pca
                                   k = 20) 
## compute distance
D              <- dist(SC.PCA$x)

## cluster super-cells
SC.clusters    <- supercell_cluster(D = D, k = 5, supercell_size = SC$supercell_size) 
SC$clustering  <- SC.clusters$clustering
```

## Map clusters of super-cells to cell lines
```{r assign supercell clustering results to cell line information}
## mapping super-cell cluster to cell line 
map.cluster.to.cell.line    <- supercell_assign(supercell_membership = SC$clustering, clusters  = SC$cell_line)
## clustering as cell line
SC$clustering_reordered     <- map.cluster.to.cell.line[SC$clustering]

supercell_plot(SC$graph.supercells, 
               group = SC$clustering_reordered, 
               seed = seed,
               alpha = -pi/2,
               main = "Super-cell colored by cluster")
```


## Differential expression analysis of clustered super-cell data 
```{r differential expression analysis}
markers.all.positive <- supercell_FindAllMarkers(ge = SC.GE, # super-cell gene expression matrix
                                                 supercell_size = SC$supercell_size, # size of super-cell for sample-weighted method
                                                 clusters = SC$clustering_reordered, # clustering
                                                 logfc.threshold = 1, # mininum log fold-change
                                                 only.pos = T) # keep only upregulated genes
markers.all.positive$H1975[1:20,]
```

## Some additional plotting options
```{r Violin plots}
genes.to.plot <- c("DHRS2", "MT1P1", "TFF1", "G6PD", "CCL2", "C1S")

supercell_VlnPlot(ge = SC.GE, supercell_size = SC$supercell_size, 
                  clusters = SC$clustering_reordered,
                  features = genes.to.plot,
                  idents = c("H1975", "H2228", "A549"), 
                  ncol = 3)

supercell_GeneGenePlot(ge = SC.GE, 
                       gene_x = genes.to.plot[1:3],
                       gene_y = genes.to.plot[4:6],
                       supercell_size = SC$supercell_size, 
                       clusters = SC$clustering_reordered,)
```


### P.S.: Super-cell to [Seurat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Seurat/index.html) object
In case you want to perform other analyses available with Seurat package, we can coerce super-cells to Seurat object with function `supercell_2_Seurat()`
```{r Seurat}
#install.packages("Seurat")
library(Seurat)

m.seurat <- supercell_2_Seurat(SC.GE = SC.GE, SC = SC, fields = c("cell_line", "clustering", "clustering_reordered"))
```
Note: since super-cells have different size (consist of different number of cells), we apply sample-weighted algorithms at most af the steps of the downstream analyses. Thus, when coercing super-cell to Seurat, we replaced PCA, saling and kNN graph of Seurat object with those obtained applying sample-weighted version of PCA, scaling or super-cell graph, respectively. If you then again apply `RunPCA`, `ScaleData`, or `FindNeighbors`, the result will be rewritten, but you will be able to access them with `Embeddings(m.seurat, reduction = "pca_weigted")`, `m.seurat@assays$RNA@misc[["scale.data.weighted"]]`, or `m.seurat@graphs$RNA_super_cells`, respectively.

```{r PCAplot}
PCAPlot(m.seurat)

### cluster super-cell network (unweighted clustering)
m.seurat <- FindClusters(m.seurat, graph.name = "RNA_nn") # now RNA_nn is super-cell network

m.seurat <- FindNeighbors(m.seurat, verbose = FALSE)  # RNA_nn has been replaced with kNN graph of super-cell (unweigted)
m.seurat <- FindClusters(m.seurat, graph.name = "RNA_nn") 
```
